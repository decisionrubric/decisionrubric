As I explore how to make progress on scaling innovation in sustainability (SIS), and in the context of shaping a program of study, I am looking at different problem solving frameworks as points of reference.

The [Alliance for Decision Education](https://alliancefordecisioneducation.org/) has a K-12 focus, 
a stellar [advisory council](https://alliancefordecisioneducation.org/learn/about-the-alliance/council/) and a cogent strategy. Their ["What is Decision Education"](https://alliancefordecisioneducation.org/what-is-decision-education/) is where I would start for an orientation to their Four Learning Domains.
Thinking Probabilistically, Valuing and Applying Rationality, Structuring Decisions, and Recognizing and Resisting Cognitive Biases embody both behavioral and practice-oriented perspectives.

Steve Blank's [Lean](https://steveblank.com/) is the prevailing market-centered model on innovation and startups. It’s also a model for how universities are organizing tech transfer investments. There are other authors in this space, and different elaborations, but Blank appears to me to be the fount.  

[Richard Rumelt](https://thecruxbook.com/about-richard-rumelt/) on strategy. 
The book is ["Good Strategy, Bad Strategy"](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/208668/good-strategy-bad-strategy-by-richard-rumelt/). 
His [McKinsey article](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-perils-of-bad-strategy)
is a concise summary. A way to think about Rumelt’s strategy is as not just figuring what goes into what market, but as a framework for how organizations solve problems.

The [Inner Development Goals](https://www.innerdevelopmentgoals.org) initiative is intended to accelerate work toward sustainability. The IDG's are aspirationally a movement which is supported by an extensive self-study curriculum designed for small community groups. 
The [toolkit](https://www.innerdevelopmentgoals.org/s/221215_IDG_Toolkit_v1.pdf) is new to me but the values resonate.
There's also a [report](https://www.innerdevelopmentgoals.org/s/220511_IDG_Report_Full.pdf)
on its development. I'm learning more about it.

I’ve omitted deeper references to Decision Analysis practice only out of laziness. The [Society of Decision Professionals]( https://www.decisionprofessionals.com/) collateral on Decision Quality is just one source.

Where does "my stuff" fit? 
It needs to be consistent with Blank, which captures how "business" thinks;
complement and extend the Alliance's well-centered and foundational Learning Domains; 
be as concrete as Rumelt but be more explicit about causal understanding (like Deming); 
and be informed by the humanism of the IDG.
