Some of the hardest decision problems we (people, business, government) face are policy designs. Policies are, in effect, what rules or incentives are put into place to shape many subsequent decisions. Public policy problems are complex are in ways that sustainability problems are complex, with the additional dimension that policies in effect regulate human behavior. Stakes can be existential, literally or perceptually.

Lots of people exercise power and make policy without much preparation. And, they may do it without data. Not all of these policies are bad, some are great. In its way, democracy is a systems design for citizen delegates to make policies that are robust over time. And, very well educated, experienced, well informed and well intentioned people have produced catastrophes. 

My belief is that we get better, more broadly beneficial policies in all realms on average if we have on average solid fundamentals in managing, deciding, reasoning critically, and applying evidence of all forms, including from data. 
These fundamentals, to me, seem like they should be part of a college curriculum core. Some schools would certainly say they are.  

In practice, the prospect of organizational leadership merits training – leadership is not just for business school, and not purely an experiential skill. In practice, data science for application to judgment and decision making problems is different than for example machine learning for automating judgment or experiment design in an interventional study.

And, when we look at complex problems, deep specific skill in policy subject areas needs to be complemented with the means to look at impacts in a multi-systems context and the means to look frankly at the obligations and consequences of the exercise of administrative power. The problem with complex problems is that everything seems to matter all at once. The job of analytic decision making is to help the policy maker accommodate the surface complexity through focusing and reducing into salient models, data-informed judgment, and  useful simulation. 

In a way, the policy design problem boils down to “what will happen to whom if we do this?” The collateral questions of “Is it fair?” “Is it sustainable?” shouldn’t seem hard. It’s the unintended consequences, and the complexity the combination of dimensions of stakeholders and underlying processes that make a robust answer hard.
